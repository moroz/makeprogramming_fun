Have you ever noticed that the first syllable in “functional programming” is “fun”?

I don’t think this is a coincidence. Let’s face the truth: there are some programming languages and technologies that are fun to use. They tend to have consistent APIs, good documentation, and a clear structure.

When you work with a Boring Stack™, programming becomes just a job, and the only thing that keeps you coding is the thought of next month’s paycheck. On the other hand, when you work with the stack you love, you don’t even feel like you’re working.

Now, what’s fun and what’s boring is completely subjective and personal. If you learned programming in the 90s and you still enjoy writing Delphi or ASP in 2020, then well, I am truly happy for you.

However, if you:

a) feel like your life is as devoid of meaning as that legacy Java project you’re maintaining,

b) feel suicidal trying to untangle the mess of a schemaless MongoDB data store designed by an intern in the remotest parts of the world,

c) were taught Java and C++ in college, but it was all just inheritance and factories, and you never really understood how anyone can actually enjoy programming, 

If any of the above evaluates true, it seems like it’s time to Make Programming Fun Again.

My name is Karol Moroz. I’m a programming aficionado born and raised in Poland. I started making YouTube videos to share the joy of programming with the world.

My favorite language is Elixir, which is a functional programming language for the Erlang virtual machine, with a syntax influenced by Ruby, compile-time macros and great scalability. It goes very well with React, GraphQL, and Postgres. So if you’re with me, leave your Boring Stack™ at work and treat yourself to some functional programming! Let’s Make Programming Fun Again!
